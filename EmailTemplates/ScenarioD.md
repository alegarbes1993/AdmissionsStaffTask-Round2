Hello Dennis,
 
Thanks for completing the requirements for your **Tech Fellow Application**. We understand your excitement on getting started with the program.
 
There has to be at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from your school who completed the requirements before we can admit tech fellows into the tech fellow training. *This means that we won’t be able to admit you until there are at least two of you who completed the admissions requirements*.
 
The waiting process might take close to a month but here are some links below that you will find useful while waiting for the confirmation:<br>
•         Review the [Fall 2021 Tech Fellow Qualifications](https://info.codepath.org/fall21techfellows)<br>
•         [Fall 2021 Tech Fellow Training Overview, Goals, Schedule and Policies](https://hackmd.io/iMnjfF-wQhKY7de5fpqryQ?view)
 
We will send you an update once we are able to admit you to the Tech Fellow Training Program.
 
Thank you very much,

**Prince Daryl Alegarbes**<br>
**CodePath.org Team**
