Hello John,
 
We understand that you are interested in attending the **Advanced Track Course**. Unfortunately, according to your pre-work score, it is only qualified for the **Beginner Track**.

As you can see on the [Advanced Track Course](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/advanced_software_eng/overview) page, the first few topics might be similar but the pacing of the track depends greatly on the level of the course and different topics are tackled over the 12-week timeline in each course.

CodePath reassures you to get the best experience possible. That's why we don’t want to put our students into a class that’s either too advanced or too basic for them.
 
Please also see links below for the overview of each course as your reference.
•	[Beginner track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/intro_software_eng/overview)
•	[Intermediate track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/intermediate_software_eng/overview)
•	[Advanced Track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/advanced_software_eng/overview)
 
I hope you understand.
 
Best Regards,

**Prince Daryl Alegarbes**
**CodePath.org Team**
