Hello Anne,

Our Summer Interview Prep course application **ended 2 weeks ago**. It is already full and we already have a long waitlist.
We understand that you will be graduating this Spring, and it breaks our heart that we are not able to offer our courses to people like you.

But we're glad to share with you our [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) containing tips and guidelines that you might find helpful.
You might want to visit our [resources page](https://codepath.org/career) as we offer guides, technical mentorship, virtual workshops, and networking events to prepare you for a career in tech. 
We highly suggest to sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) in case there are future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in.


Thank you for understanding.

Best Regards,

**Prince Daryl Alegarbes**<br>
**CodePath.org Team**
