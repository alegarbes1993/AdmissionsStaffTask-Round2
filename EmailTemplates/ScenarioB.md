Dear Jane,

Thank you for your interest and completing the application process. We do really appreciate your effort.

However, *the courses that CodePath offers are specifically targeted at students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States*. CodePath currently runs classes in Haiti and used to run classes in Taiwan. We are planning to expand to other countries in the future but not as of yet.

All of our applications have at least two sections for eligibility checks on the front page that need to be checked precisely.

We understand that you are very interested in attending our course. I suggest that you sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) as we will notify you once classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means.

In the meantime, you can also check other resources in learning Android. We also have an extensive [list of Android resources online](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources).

*We aim to expand our audience for future programs and to be able to bring programs to your area soon*. 

Thank you for understanding.


All the best,

**Prince Daryl Alegarbes**<br>
