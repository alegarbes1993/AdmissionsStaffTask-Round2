**Incident Summary:**<br>
Accidentally tagged applicant to Admission Confirmation Required even if the school that she is currently enrolled in is not offered in iOS Course this Fall 2021. Applicant is enrolled in Florida International University with a course major of Computer Engineering and has a Pre-work completed status in the reviewer tool.

**Steps on how I arrived into that error:**
1. Applicant in Pre-work completed status which is for Application Processing
2. Admission staff overlooked "Location: z Other" in the application form.
3. Admission staff only checked the What is your college major, What is your expected graduation year, What is your current education status and What college or university do you attend?
4. Admission staff was not able to verify if the current university enrolled is being offered for this semester.

**Actions that needs to be done:**
1. Reach out to the applicant personally in the email and apologize for the mistake
2. Offer the applicant to have the Observer access if he/she still wants to proceed with the course (specify the details if tagged as an Observer)
3. Offer the applicant that other courses like Android/Cybersecurity is being offered in his/her current enrolled university
4. Process the transfer/status on how the applicant wants to proceed

**Canned Reply:**<br>
Hello Applicant, <br>

I hope you are doing well. We really appreciate your interest in joining the iOS Course for this Fall 2021. However, upon reviewing your application, I have checked that you are currently enrolled in Florida International University and unfortunately, we are not offering the iOS course in the university you indicated in your application for the upcoming semester. <br>

We have mistakenly sent you an admission confirmation and know that you already have confirmed your admission. We really apologize for the mistake.<br>

But on the positive side, we can tag you into **Observer Status** for this round.<br>
Some key elements on how this is different from participating in the actual class:<br>
- You have access to the [course materials online](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/ios_university/pages/bootcamp_structure) but are not part of a class<br>
- No due dates or any expectations of observers imposed by us<br>

On the other hand, we are also offering an [Android Course](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/android_university/pages/bootcamp_structure) this Fall 2021 in your university. I can assist to facilitate your transfer from the iOS course to Android course if you wish to.<br>

We’re eager to make this course available at your university as soon as possible! To help us in our effort, we would appreciate it if you could spend a few minutes to fill out a [university request form](https://info.codepath.org/campus).<br>

Again, we’d like to thank you for taking the time to check out CodePath and hope you sign up to our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) and consider reapplying once this course becomes available at your university. <br>

I hope you understand.


Best regards,
