**Incident Summary:**<br>
Accidentally tagged applicant to Admission Confirmation Required even if the school that she is currently enrolled in is not offered in iOS Course this Fall 2021. Applicant is enrolled in Florida International University with a course major of Computer Engineering and has a Pre-work completed status in the reviewer tool.

**Steps on how I arrived into that error:**
1. Applicant in Pre-work completed status which is for Application Processing
2. Admission staff overlooked "Location: z Other" in the application form.
3. Admission staff only checked the What is your college major, What is your expected graduation year, What is your current education status and What college or university do you attend?
4. Admission staff was not able to verify if the current university enrolled is being offered for this semester.

**Actions that needs to be done:**
1. Reach out to the applicant personally in the email and apologize for the mistake
2. Offer the applicant to have the Observer access if he/she still wants to proceed with the course (specify the details if tagged as an Observer)
3. Offer the applicant that other courses like Android/Cybersecurity is being offered in his/her current enrolled university
4. Process the transfer/status on how the applicant wants to proceed

Hello Applicant, <br>

Good day! I hope you are doing well. We really appreciate your interest in joining the iOS Course for this Fall 2021. However, upon further reviewing your application profile, we verified that you are currently enrolled in Florida International University and unfortunately, we are not offering the iOS program at FIU this Fall 2021 semester. We know that we’ve sent you an admission spot for confirmation for the iOS program but since we are not running this at your University, we have two (2) options we’d like to offer:<br>

(1) An observer access where you can audit the iOS materials at your own pace and time. On how this is different from the actual class:<br>
- You will have access to the [course materials online](https://courses.codepath.org/sessions) but are not part of any class <br>
- No due dates or any expectations imposed by us<br>

(2) Fortunately, we are running the [Android Course](https://courses.codepath.org/courses/android_university/pages/bootcamp_structure) this Fall 2021 at FIU. It looks like you’ve also started an application for Android, if you’re interested, we can facilitate the transfer of your admission to the Android cohort and will guarantee your a spot. Here’s the [syllabus](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/syllabus) for the Android course and we have already finalized the [schedule details](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/android_university/admissions_details) as below:<br>
- Start Date: Aug 23<br>
- Schedule: Monday, Wednesday at 5:30 PM - 7:30 PM EDT<br>
- Format: Remote via Zoom<br>

Also we are very eager to make the iOS course available at your FIU in the next admissions cycle. To help us in our effort, we would appreciate it if you could spend a few minutes to fill out [this form](https://info.codepath.org/campusf21) and the outreach team will reach out to you for the next steps.<br>

Let us know which option you would like to pursue. Have a wonderful rest of your day! <br>
